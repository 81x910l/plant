@article{diekmann_formulation_2001,
	Abstract = {Abstract. This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour
and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps,
by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time.
A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for
reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can
constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients.
A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composi-
tion at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping
principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved
the nonlinear problem.},

	Abstract = {We define a fitness concept applicable to structured metapopulations consisting of infinitely many equally coupled patches. In addition, we introduce a more easily calculated quantity R-m that relates to fitness in the same manner as R-o relates to fitness in ordinary population dynamics: the R-m of a mutant is only defined when the resident population dynamics concierges to a point equilibrium and R-m is larger (smaller) than 1 if and only if mutant fitness is positive (negative). R-m corresponds to the average number of newborn dispersers resulting from the ton average less than one) local colony founded by a newborn disperser. Efficient algorithms for calculating its numerical value are provided. As an example of the usefulness of these concepts we calculate the evolutionarily stable conditional dispersal strategy for individuals that can account for the local population density in their dispersal decisions. Below a threshold density (x) over tilde, at which staying and leaving are equality profitable, everybody should stay and above (x) over tilde everybody should leave, where profitability is measured as the mean number of dispersers produced through lines of descent consisting of only non-dispersers. {[References:} 30] 30},

The moments of size distribution are calculated based on the diffusion process. Theoretical analyses are made of the mechanisms and the dynamics of size distribution pattern of an even-aged plant population based on the experiemntal data of Impatiens balsamina L. Plant height, stem diameter and individual plant weight have their specific size-dependent growth pattern, and show almost normal, positively skewed and more positively skewed size distribution, respectively. The stochastic model incorporating size-dependence of individual growth explains these phenomena theoretically. The ecological meaning of the growth and size distribution patterns is discussed. The hypothesis that dry matter production by photosynthesis is first allocated to height growth and then to diameter growth is proposed.},

@article{de_roos_studying_1992,
	Abstract = {We introduce a versatile model formulation, called the escalator boxcar train, that can be used to study the dynamics of populations structured by age, size, or any other physiological trait. Spanning the entire spectrum between the classical, age-structured, Leslie matrix models and continuous-time, physiologically structured population models, it combines the computational ease of the matrix models with the flexibility of the continuous-time models: it allows the population dynamics to depend on an arbitrary number of individual characteristics and can account for nonlinear interactions of the population with its (fluctuating) environment, for density dependence in individual behavior, and for a continuous reproduction process. Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a food-dependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role. The influence of "growth-curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics. The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.},

	Abstract = {A numerical integration method is introduced for the class of hyperbolic partial differential equations that occur in physiologically structured population models. These equations describe the time evolution of the population density-function over the individual state-space ?. Exploiting the biological interpretation of the equation, this density-function is represented by a set of moments over a collection of subdomains in ?, moving along the characteristics of the partial differential equation {(PDE).} These moments are readily interpreted as numbers of individuals in a cohort, mean individual state in a cohort, etc. The numerical method consists of approximating the differential {equations.The} method appears to be very efficient for this special type of {PDE.} It combines such desirable properties as as lack of dispersion and dissipation and a preservation of monotonicity of the density function along the characteristics with a strong relation to the biological background of the equations for these moments to arrive at a closed system of ordinary differential equations. The method also allows one to incorporate the usual type of nonlinearities that occur in physiologically structured population models. A numerical example is presented as an illustration of the application of the method.},

The mechanism behind those findings has been temporal variation caused by cyclic or chaotic local dynamics, or temporally and spatially varying carrying capacities. We present a new mechanism: spatial heterogeneity in the sense of different patch types with sufficient proportions, and temporal variation caused by catastrophes. The model where this occurs is a generalization of the model by Gyllenberg and Metz (2001). Their model is a size-structured metapopulation model with infinitely many identical patches. We present a generalized version of their metapopulation model allowing for different types of patches. In structured population models, defining and computing fitness in polymorphic situations is, in general, difficult. We present an efficient method, which can be applied also to other structured population or metapopulation models.},

@article{moorcroft_method_2001,
	Abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model {(ED).} We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as {ED} to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size-and agc-structured {(SAS)} approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to, make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the {SAS} approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15 degrees N to 15 degrees S, showing that the {SAS} equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production. {[References:} 105]},

@article{kohyama_size-structured_1993,
	Abstract = {The forest architecture hypothesis of tree species coexistence proposed here was developed from a general model of size-structured tree populations in gap-dynamic rain forest. The model consists of a submodel describing the dynamics of the age distribution of local stands, which reflects gap-dynamic processes in a whole forest, and another describing the change in size distribution of trees in stands of each age. The model expresses the dynamics of both species-averaged systems and multi-species systems. In the model, the intensity of suppression of tree size growth, survival and seedling recruitment is a function of local crowding. Crowding is measured in each stand in terms of the cumulative basal area of trees of all species that are larger than the subject individual, while the potential rate of seedling recruitment is proportional to the basal area of mother trees in a whole forest. Tree mortality results either from thinning due to local crowding or from gap formation. Trees surviving gap formation contribute to regeneration in a newborn gap. Simulation was carried out using permanent plot data from a warm-temperate rain forest. The simulation for a whole tree population converged to a unique equilibrium state with a stationary stand age distribution and a stationary size distribution in each stand. Simulated size distributions matched observed distributions in gaps and closed stands. The dynamics of a multi-species system composed of representative canopy, subcanopy and understorey species (all non-pioneer but with different tolerance levels) was also simulated. Results showed convergence to a stable equilibrium coexistence within a limited range of species parameters. Although stable coexistence also resulted from the model without stand mosaic by means of the trade-off between potential maximum size and potential recruitment rate, inclusion of gap dynamics in the model widened the range of coexistence in this trade-off space and reduced the time for convergence to equilibrium. Gap dynamics provided further possibilities for coexistence by various trade-offs e.g. between potential size growth rate and susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate. Results suggested the importance of vertical and horizontal structure of forest in maintaining tree species diversity.},

We also study how trophic interactions, interference competition, and energy availability affect a food web’s maximum trophic level and contrast this with conditions for high diversity. We find that there is not always a positive relationship between conditions that promote initial diversification and eventual diversity, and that the most diverse food webs often do not have the highest trophic levels.},

However, it uses an oversimplified picture of seed tolerance, with an infinitely sharp threshold: the probability that a seed tolerate a given stress level is either 1 or 0. This invites a revision of the model, presented here. We demonstrate that this simplification has large impacts on model behavior, including altering predictions regarding limiting similarity, raising expected diversity levels, and lessening expected spacing between species along the trait axis. Such dramatic impacts ultimately stem from the fact that a discontinuity in the probability of tolerating a site drastically reduces competition between similar species. This is one example of a class of models with a nondifferentiable peak in the competition kernel, which we recently showed is produced by resource use unrealistically modeled as discontinuous and affects fundamental predictions regarding limiting similarity. This article illustrates those general results and offers a revised model of the tolerance-fecundity trade-off.},

	abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species1–3. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical {difficulties2,3.Most} previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others4–10. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species10–18},

	abstract = {This study extends the framework of adaptive dynamics to function-valued traits. Such adaptive traits naturally arise in a great variety of settings: variable or heterogeneous environments, age-structured populations, phenotypic plasticity, patterns of growth and form, resource gradients, and in many other areas of evolutionary ecology. Adaptive dynamics theory allows analysing the long-term evolution of such traits under the density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection pressures resulting from feedback between evolving populations and their ecological environment. Starting from individual-based considerations, we derive equations describing the expected dynamics of a function-valued trait in asexually reproducing populations under mutation-limited evolution, thus generalizing the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics to function-valued traits. We explain in detail how to account for various kinds of evolutionary constraints on the adaptive dynamics of function-valued traits. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we present applications to two specific examples that address, respectively, the evolution of metabolic investment strategies along resource gradients, and the evolution of seasonal flowering schedules in temporally varying environments.},

We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Understanding evolutionary co-ordination among different life-history traits is a key challenge for ecology and evolution. Here, we develop a general quantitative model predicting how offspring size should scale with adult size by combining a simple model for life-history evolution with a frequency-dependent survivorship model. The key innovation is that larger offspring are afforded three different advantages during ontogeny: higher survivorship per time, a shortened juvenile phase, and advantage during size-competitive growth. In this model, it turns out that size-asymmetric advantage during competition is the factor driving evolution towards larger offspring sizes. For simplified and limiting cases the model is shown to produce the same predictions as the previously existing theory it is founded on. The explicit treatment of different survival advantages has biologically important new effects, mainly through an interaction between total maternal investment in reproduction and the duration of competitive growth. This leads on to explain alternative allometries between log offspring size and log adult size, as observed in mammals (slope=0.95) and plants (slope=0.54). Further, it suggests how these differences relate quantitatively to specific biological processes during recruitment. In these ways the model generalizes across previous theory and provides explanations for some differences between major taxa.},

A single seed size is found to be never evolutionarily stable. I always find at least some continuous adaptive variation in seed size. The model generates the following predictions. At least some continuous variation in seed size is adaptive. Plants with many resources have more variable seeds than plants with few resources. Plants with low juvenile mortality have more variable seeds than plants with high juvenile mortality. Plants with aggregated seed dispersal have seed size distributions that are more biased toward small seeds compared to plants with more even seed dispersal. An explicit formula for the evolutionarily stable seed size distribution was obtained for Poisson-distributed seed numbers and for negative binomial distributed seed numbers per safe site. The application of the model to seed size distributions of entire populations or plant communities is discussed. [References: 60]},

Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's `soft selection' model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.

	abstract = {We present a model for the evolutionary dynamics of seed size when there is a trade-off between seed size and seed number, and seedlings from large seeds are better competitors and have a higher precompetitive survival than seedlings from small seeds. We find that strong competitive asymmetry, high resource levels, and intermediate harshness of the precompetitive environment favor coexistence of plants with different seed sizes. If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages.

It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function."

High levels of polymorphism may build up during evolution. The coevolution of strategies in polymorphic populations, however, may also lead to extinction, which decreases the level of polymorphism.

There is now a deeper understanding of how competitive interactions influence community structure, for instance, how the shape of competition kernels can determine the clustering of species' traits. Competition is typically weaker for greater phenotypic difference, and the shape of the dependence defines a competition kernel. The clustering tendencies of kernels interact with other effects, such as variation in resource availability along a niche axis, but the kernel shape can have a decisive influence on community structure.

Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence through a competition–colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites. Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance–fecundity trade-off enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models with and without seed limitation. The tolerance–fecundity mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

	abstract = {Adaptive dynamics in two-dimensional phenotype space is investigated by computer simulation. The model assumes Lotka-Voltera-type competition and a stochastic mutation process. The carrying capacity has a single maximum in the origin of the strategy space and the competition coefficient decreases with strategy difference. Evolutionary branching, an asexual analog of adaptive speciation, is observed with suitable parameters. The branching at the singular point, which is a fixed point of the directional evolution, may occur into two or three, but not more, directions. Further branchings may occur after the initial separation. The probability of threebranching is studied as a function of several parameters. We conclude that the two-way branching is the predominant mode of adaptive speciation.},
