@article{diekmann_formulation_2001,
	Abstract = {Abstract. This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour 
and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps, 
by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time. 
A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for 
reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can 
constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients. 
A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composi- 
tion at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping 
principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved 
the nonlinear problem.},

@article{metz_how_2001,
	Abstract = {We define a fitness concept applicable to structured metapopulations consisting of infinitely many equally coupled patches. In addition, we introduce a more easily calculated quantity R-m that relates to fitness in the same manner as R-o relates to fitness in ordinary population dynamics: the R-m of a mutant is only defined when the resident population dynamics concierges to a point equilibrium and R-m is larger (smaller) than 1 if and only if mutant fitness is positive (negative). R-m corresponds to the average number of newborn dispersers resulting from the ton average less than one) local colony founded by a newborn disperser. Efficient algorithms for calculating its numerical value are provided. As an example of the usefulness of these concepts we calculate the evolutionarily stable conditional dispersal strategy for individuals that can account for the local population density in their dispersal decisions. Below a threshold density (x) over tilde, at which staying and leaving are equality profitable, everybody should stay and above (x) over tilde everybody should leave, where profitability is measured as the mean number of dispersers produced through lines of descent consisting of only non-dispersers. {[References:} 30] 30},

	Abstract = {A stochastic model for growth and size distribution in plant populations is proposed, which is described by the Kolmogorov forward equation (diffusion equation). The moments of size distribution are calculated based on the diffusion process. Theoretical analyses are made of the mechanisms and the dynamics of size distribution pattern of an even-aged plant population based on the experiemntal data of Impatiens balsamina L. Plant height, stem diameter and individual plant weight have their specific size-dependent growth pattern, and show almost normal, positively skewed and more positively skewed size distribution, respectively. The stochastic model incorporating size-dependence of individual growth explains these phenomena theoretically. The ecological meaning of the growth and size distribution patterns is discussed. The hypothesis that dry matter production by photosynthesis is first allocated to height growth and then to diameter growth is proposed.},

@article{de_roos_studying_1992,
	Abstract = {We introduce a versatile model formulation, called the escalator boxcar train, that can be used to study the dynamics of populations structured by age, size, or any other physiological trait. Spanning the entire spectrum between the classical, age-structured, Leslie matrix models and continuous-time, physiologically structured population models, it combines the computational ease of the matrix models with the flexibility of the continuous-time models: it allows the population dynamics to depend on an arbitrary number of individual characteristics and can account for nonlinear interactions of the population with its (fluctuating) environment, for density dependence in individual behavior, and for a continuous reproduction process. Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a food-dependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role. The influence of "growth-curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics. The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.},

	Abstract = {A numerical integration method is introduced for the class of hyperbolic partial differential equations that occur in physiologically structured population models. These equations describe the time evolution of the population density-function over the individual state-space ?. Exploiting the biological interpretation of the equation, this density-function is represented by a set of moments over a collection of subdomains in ?, moving along the characteristics of the partial differential equation {(PDE).} These moments are readily interpreted as numbers of individuals in a cohort, mean individual state in a cohort, etc. The numerical method consists of approximating the differential {equations.The} method appears to be very efficient for this special type of {PDE.} It combines such desirable properties as as lack of dispersion and dissipation and a preservation of monotonicity of the density function along the characteristics with a strong relation to the biological background of the equations for these moments to arrive at a closed system of ordinary differential equations. The method also allows one to incorporate the usual type of nonlinearities that occur in physiologically structured population models. A numerical example is presented as an illustration of the application of the method.},

The mechanism behind those findings has been temporal variation caused by cyclic or chaotic local dynamics, or temporally and spatially varying carrying capacities. We present a new mechanism: spatial heterogeneity in the sense of different patch types with sufficient proportions, and temporal variation caused by catastrophes. The model where this occurs is a generalization of the model by Gyllenberg and Metz (2001). Their model is a size-structured metapopulation model with infinitely many identical patches. We present a generalized version of their metapopulation model allowing for different types of patches. In structured population models, defining and computing fitness in polymorphic situations is, in general, difficult. We present an efficient method, which can be applied also to other structured population or metapopulation models.},

@article{moorcroft_method_2001,
	Abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model {(ED).} We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as {ED} to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size-and agc-structured {(SAS)} approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to, make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the {SAS} approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15 degrees N to 15 degrees S, showing that the {SAS} equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production. {[References:} 105]},

@article{kohyama_size-structured_1993,
	Abstract = {The forest architecture hypothesis of tree species coexistence proposed here was developed from a general model of size-structured tree populations in gap-dynamic rain forest. The model consists of a submodel describing the dynamics of the age distribution of local stands, which reflects gap-dynamic processes in a whole forest, and another describing the change in size distribution of trees in stands of each age. The model expresses the dynamics of both species-averaged systems and multi-species systems. In the model, the intensity of suppression of tree size growth, survival and seedling recruitment is a function of local crowding. Crowding is measured in each stand in terms of the cumulative basal area of trees of all species that are larger than the subject individual, while the potential rate of seedling recruitment is proportional to the basal area of mother trees in a whole forest. Tree mortality results either from thinning due to local crowding or from gap formation. Trees surviving gap formation contribute to regeneration in a newborn gap. Simulation was carried out using permanent plot data from a warm-temperate rain forest. The simulation for a whole tree population converged to a unique equilibrium state with a stationary stand age distribution and a stationary size distribution in each stand. Simulated size distributions matched observed distributions in gaps and closed stands. The dynamics of a multi-species system composed of representative canopy, subcanopy and understorey species (all non-pioneer but with different tolerance levels) was also simulated. Results showed convergence to a stable equilibrium coexistence within a limited range of species parameters. Although stable coexistence also resulted from the model without stand mosaic by means of the trade-off between potential maximum size and potential recruitment rate, inclusion of gap dynamics in the model widened the range of coexistence in this trade-off space and reduced the time for convergence to equilibrium. Gap dynamics provided further possibilities for coexistence by various trade-offs e.g. between potential size growth rate and susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate. Results suggested the importance of vertical and horizontal structure of forest in maintaining tree species diversity.},
