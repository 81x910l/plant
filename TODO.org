* Rcpp error handling

Should not do Rf_error(), as that longjmp's over destructors.  Use
Rcpp::error instead.  However, this is made difficult by the lack of
printf-like behaviour there.  Most Rf_error calls currently compose
strings, and this is hard in C++ code, apparently.

* Interfaces:

- births, deaths export for species, patch, metacommunity

* Consistency

- consistency of iterator typedefs (and others)

* How do patches cope with being stepped when empty?
(e.g., post disturbance)
