* Rcpp error handling

Should not do Rf_error(), as that longjmp's over destructors.  Use
Rcpp::error instead.

* Exporting utility functions

Convert remaining utility functions to use Rcpp::function.

* Interfaces:

- births, deaths export for species, patch, metacommunity

* Consistency

- consistency of iterator typedefs (and others)
- age vs r_age() -- this is an unwanted distinction, but somewhat
  necessary because of the name collision.

* R interface

- add_seeds and add_plants are not used consistently.
  - I think that add_seeds should probably do the full germination-test,
    while add_plants could skip it?

* Biology

- disturbance regime is not yet handled -- could solver numerically or
  analytically...
