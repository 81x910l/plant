\title{Expand Cohort Schedule to Include Mutants}
\usage{
expand_schedule(schedule, n_mutant)
}
\arguments{
\item{schedule}{A \code{CohortSchedule} object, set up for the
residents.}

\item{n_mutant}{Number of mutant schedules to generate}
}
\description{
Expand schedule to include mutants.  All mutants get the same
schedule, equal to all the unique times that any resident was
introduced.  This results in more work than is really needed, but
should be reasonable most of the time.
